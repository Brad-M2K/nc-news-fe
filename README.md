- there is a tasks list using trello i have also been setting up. but to be honest i strugged using excalidraw and tried out a few differnet things thne ended up back at excalidraw. bit of a frustrating planning day but I already know what i want to do and drawing shapes inst going to get me any closer lol

## Here is my trello project board

- this will also be fleshed out more as i go fro now just wanted to cover certain grounds and iterate as i go and improve.

- FYI planning folder holds component tree as it is for now and also image of drawing which again is not great but it was requested

### will clean up this read me but just wanted to give some more context
