# NC News — Longterm Vision & Feature Expansion

This document outlines the longterm vision and future feature roadmap for the NC News frontend project. The goal is to turn this student project into a dynamic, scalable, and interactive news platform — one that can serve as both a portfolio piece and a real product with potential.

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

To build a fully featured, community-driven news platform that allows users to:
- Browse and filter high-quality news articles
- Engage in topic-based discussions
- Share opinions in a way that adds value to the news ecosystem

The frontend will be sleek, reactive, and engaging — designed to mimic a professional-level product that could integrate into any fan-based or niche journalism community.

## 🔐 Private Premium Extension (Optional Future)
Designed for niche communities or fan bases:

## 🧠 Vision Statement

This isn't just a student news project. It's a prototype for a modern fan-first platform — one that blends external articles, community discussion, and curated content to offer something unique. It empowers readers, rewards thoughtful engagement, and gives smaller communities a louder voice.

Think: Reddit meets Substack meets Sky Sports, without the algorithmic clutter.

- Notifications when topics you follow get new content
- Dark mode toggle
- Admin dashboard for content curation

## 📌 Notes
Avoid using real names or channels while building this public-facing version. Keep motivations and structure generalised, but strong enough to showcase technical skills and product thinking.
